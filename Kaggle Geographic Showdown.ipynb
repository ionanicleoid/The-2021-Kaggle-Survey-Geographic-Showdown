The countries which perform the best will rank the highest. Therefore, a rank of 1 show cases they are gold medallist for this award. Each leader board is designed to show-off the gold, silver and bronze awardees with the use of colour. \n",

    "Our analysis makes use of sunburst charts, to visualise countries which preform poorly in a particular award. The outside circle of the sunburst shows all the countries, and the inner circle shows the continents. Where the countries with the largest wedge perform the worst. A colour scheme is also used, so that the poorer the ranking the warmer the colour becomes, with dark maroon being the worst ranking. The sunburst charts are used to help visualize countries that have room for improvement 😊.\n",

    "The project results are also displayed on interactive globes, which were created with Plotly. Where a user can spin and play with the globe to view the results. As well as being fun, the decision to plot the results on a globe was taken to avoid bias. This is due to the cartographic design challenge of plotting the Earth, an ellipsoid object, on a 2D plane such as a piece of paper. As depending on the projection one can increase the look of the size of an area, but on the same effect decrease the size of another. Historically, maps emphasised the United Kingdom, during the British Empire, whilst making countries closer to the equator seem smaller. Bringing bias to how data is represented. Which of course we try to mitigate and to challenge techniques with may induce it. A good book to read on this is ‘How to Lie with Maps’ by Mark Monmonier. For this project we opted to centre the globe on the winning country for the award. \n",
